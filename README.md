# 📍 Pinpoint – Server

Welcome to the **server** side of **Pinpoint**, an EdTech civic engagement platform designed with user-friendliness in mind. This backend powers the functionality of the Pinpoint website, handling routes, data management, and API integrations that enable users to engage with civic data intuitively and efficiently.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Pinpoint aims to empower users by making legislative and civic data more accessible. The server is the backbone of the project, connecting the frontend interface with powerful tools and databases that allow users to:

- Explore interactive maps  
- Track and view government bills  
- Learn about local officials  
- Register and manage users  
- Access educational content

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Node.js** + **Express** – Server framework  
- **MongoDB** – Database for storing users and other data  
- **Open States API** – For fetching live data on bills and government officials  
- **Postman** – Used for testing routes during development

## 🔌 API Integrations

### Open States API

We utilize the [Open States API](https://www.openstates.org/) to fetch real-time civic data, such as:

- Active and historical bills  
- State-level officials and their contact info  
- Legislative activity by region  

API requests are managed through our custom controllers and parsed for frontend use.
